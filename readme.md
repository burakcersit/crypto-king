# Crypto at a Glance

A JavaScript-based applicatiopn that tracks and displays cryptocurrency trends and fluctuations
using the Fetch API in JavaScript to retrieve data. We will use the Coin-Ranking cryptocurrency site as an example site in retrieving the data. We will look at the process of getting an API Key and then retrieving the data we want and then display it in a Bootstrap 5 table.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://joemogy.github.io/crypto-king/index.html)
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
## Features

- Integrates JSON payload from Coinranking.com API to display a configurable graph of major cryptocurrency/USD pairs.
- Implemented responsive design with CSS media queries & jQuery, along with Bootstrap CSS grid system library to enhance cross-platform user experience.
- Utilized Chart.JS library for clean representation of user-interactive sparkline graph data.
- Hosted final prototype using github-pages rather than AWS to remain time efficient, as it enables updates to be pushed live from github without need to FTP.
